Cross Cutting Concerns
things we need applied for all(or some) actions
Examples

Authentication
Authorization
Logging
General Error Handling
We have a video on adding a MessageHandler to implement an Api Key check 
Action Filter Attribute
perform your authentication check

In your controller class decorate the class with the Authentication class name you created to  perform the authentication.
If the class is Autherization Filter the decoration might look like this:

Cross Cutting Concerns 
Something we want to apply in all cases
for Example
We want all request to go through security
we want to log all requests

Filters and Message Handlers
Two ways to handle cross cutting concerns
 
Use MessageHandlers when you want to apply the action to all HTTP
requests(sounds good for security)

Use Filters when you want to apply the action
only to requests thatare dispatched to the controller or action where the filter is applied

a Message Handler is a class that receives an HTTP requests and reurns an HTTP response

Tyupically, a series of message handlers are chained together.The first handlerr receives an HTTP request, does some processing, and gives the request to the next handler. At some point, the response is created  and goes back 
up the chain. This pattern is called a delegting handler.
